## Quick Start

To get this project up and running locally on your computer:

1. You can open this project in Pycharm and the IDE will automatically configure it for you. The project contains a Python virtual environment, so you can set it up easily.
2. If it doesn't work, you can just visit the URL above online. I have almost a month left in my free trial, so you can access the website  before it expires.
